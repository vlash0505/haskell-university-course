<h1>Functional programming university course</h1>
<h3>Lab 1</h3>
<p>Use haskell classes and instances. Use MySQL as RDBMS<br><br>
Develop an information system "Faculty Network Newspaper". The database tables contain the following information: Title of the article or graphic material, author, annotation text, etc. where publication files are recorded, information about readers and their feedback, statistics about individual materials. Provide the possibility of adding and editing of information. </p>

<h3>Lab 2</h3>
<p>Create a multi-threaded application. Parallelize the search for the minimum path in a weighted graph on n-threads. Show the efficiency of the algorithm in terms of time.</p>

<h3>Tasks</h3>
<p>
1. Find such a path of the knight on the chessboard that it visits each square only once.<br>
2. Create a multilayer perceptron, learning by the method of back propagation of error.<br>
3. Solve the travelling salesman problem using a genetic algorithm.<br>
4. Determine all paths in the connected graph from one selected vertex to another.<br>
5. Using sockets and the threepenny library, create a chat with a graphical interface<br>
6. Create an XML file and its corresponding DTD definition.<br>
7. Using OpenGL, create a Haskell application that simulates the collision of two balls.<br>
8. Write a program to hide information in a gif file (use the last significant bit to hide information). Use the GD library.</p>
